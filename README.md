# Props Drilling & React Lifecycle Methods

## Props Drilling: 
- Passing data down through multiple levels of nested components, often leading to code complexity.

## React Lifecycle Methods: 
- Functions that execute at specific points in a component's existence (e.g., mounting, updating, unmounting), allowing for side effects and data management.
